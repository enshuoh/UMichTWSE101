### [Leetcode 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/description/)

* On a staircase, the $i$-th step has some non-negative cost `cost[i]` assigned (0 indexed).
* Once you pay the cost, you can either climb **one** or **two** steps. You need to find minimum cost to reach the top of the floor, and you can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

### Longest Common Subsequence

* 給你兩個字串，問你他們的<span class="blue">共同最長部份子序列</span>的長度為何？

### [Leetcode 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/description/)

* Given a string $s$, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in $s$. You may assume that the maximum length of $s$ is 1000.

### [Leetcode 132. Palindrome Partitioning II](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning-ii/description/)

* Given a string $s$, partition $s$ such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
* Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of $s$.

### [Leetcode 646. Maximum Length of Pair Chain](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-pair-chain/description/)

* You are given $n$ pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number.
* Now, we define a pair $(c, d)$ can follow another pair $(a, b)$ if and only if $b < c$. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.
* Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order.

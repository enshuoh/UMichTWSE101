### [Leetcode 508. Most Frequent Subtree Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-frequent-subtree-sum/description/)


* Given the root of a tree, you are asked to find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself). So what is the most frequent subtree sum value? If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

### [Hackerrank. Tree Pruning](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tree-pruning/problem)

* A tree, $t$, has $n$ vertices numbered from $1$ to $n$ and is rooted at vertex $1$. Each vertex $i$ has an integer weight, $w_i$, associated with it, and $t$'s total weight is the sum of the weights of its nodes. A single remove operation removes the subtree rooted at some arbitrary vertex $u$ from tree $t$.
* Given $t$, perform up to $k$ remove operations so that the total weight of the remaining vertices in $t$ is maximal. Then print $t$'s maximal total weight on a new line.

* Given a tree-shaped kingdom, with $c$ cities being infected. In order to save at least $k$ cities being infected, you need to find the minimum number of edges that needs to be destroyed.

* Given a tree, output the minimum number of lights that needs to be set in order to cover every edge. Also output the number of ways choosing the location of these lights, modulo 10007.

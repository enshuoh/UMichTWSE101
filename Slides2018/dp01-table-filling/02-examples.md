### [Leetcode 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/description/)

* On a staircase, the $i$-th step has some non-negative cost `cost[i]` assigned (0 indexed).
* Once you pay the cost, you can either climb **one** or **two** steps. You need to find minimum cost to reach the top of the floor, and you can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

### [Leetcode 646. Maximum Length of Pair Chain](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-pair-chain/description/)

* You are given $n$ pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number.
* Now, we define a pair $(c, d)$ can follow another pair $(a, b)$ if and only if $b < c$. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.
* Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order.
